DESCRIPTION

  **This project is archived and no longer maintained.**
  
  SmartReadArgs is a Workbench/CLI transparent interface to
  ReadArgs().

  In case of a Workbench start, it analyzes the WBStartup message and
  possible tooltypes. These are converted to a text string that can be
  passed to ReadArgs() like before.

  If the application was stared from CLI, it simply calls ReadArgs()
  without the conversion step.

FEATURES

  - Accepts multi-selected files from Workbench
  - Internal handles WINDOW tooltype to open CLI in case there is any
    output necessary if started from Workbench
  - Full source code included

NEW FEATURES (to ExtReadArgs)

  - Fixed a couple of minor bugs
  - Ignores tooltypes not being part of the template given (useful
    for commodities etc.)
  - Supports NewIcons also on systems without NewIcons running
  - Included Makefile for GCC

USAGE

  Read the autodocs to learn how to use it. Take a look at the example
  "test.c" and play with it.

  The full source code is included.
