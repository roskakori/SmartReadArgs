ExtReadArgs - ReadMe
====================

Here is a transparent CLI/Workbench ReadArgs() interface !

No guarantee of any kind is given that the programs described in
this document are 100% reliable. You are using this material at your
own risk. The author takes no responsibility for any damage which 
is caused by using these programs.

You can modify the source for your own purposes, and if you think it's
a enhancement please send it to me, so I can include these changes to the
next release.

To install the header and object file just double click the SMakeFile icon
for SASC. If you want to remake it with SASC, replace the "install" ToolType
with the "release" ToolType and double click the icon !

If you remake ExtReadArgs(), the makefile will use two programs to extract
and convert the docs (makedoc and xrefconvert).If you don't have these
programs the make ignores the command not found error.
